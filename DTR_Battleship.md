Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Andrew and Jeremiah

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): We hope to complete each iteration fully and ideally get a 4 all the way through the rubric. We want to ideally work on the project together the whole way through to know exactly what is going on for the entire project.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Easygoing and adaptive to work best with my partner. Analytical thinking to breakdown each step of project.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: Not have any group issues with communication and stregthen each others weakness through the project.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): During the week, 4:30-7 pm and have a "state of the union" on Friday to see how much we need to work on the weekend.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): Ideally work together through the entire project on slack and or zoom.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Knowing conceptually what we need to do and really working together to actually use it.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Work together to start off the project and revisit the idea of divide and conquer.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): Using Tuple to work together at first and breaking out possibly in the future.

Pomodoro Break Schedule: Whenever either one of us need a break for however long.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Be direct as possible when we have issues.

Additional Remote Considerations:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): Tulpe

Day 1 Agenda: Discuss the requirements
